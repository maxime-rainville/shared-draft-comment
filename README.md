# Silverstripe CMS Comments on shared draft

This is a Silverstripe CMS module that adds the capability to leave comments on shared draft directly in the front end of your website.

## Warning

This is an experimental module. Use at your own risk.

## What does it do?

The [silverstripe/sharedraftcontent](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-sharedraftcontent) allows content authors to create special links to draft content. Content author can then choose to share those draft links with their stakeholders so they can preview the content.

However, any feedback on the draft content then has to be collected in side channels like email message or Google Doc.

This module extends the capability of the shared draft content module so people looking at a preview link can leave comment directly in the front end. Other users looking at the draft can view their comments and leave replies as well.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
